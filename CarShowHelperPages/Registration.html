<h3>Registration is a feature-rich form. Practice first before
	using at a show.</h3>

	day-of-show registration.</p>
Possible solutions:
<ul>
	<li>Divide registration among several several computers assigning
		a range of car numbers to each user, e.g. 1-99 to user1 100-199 to
		user2 etc. and merge the registration sheet after registration is
		closed.</li>
	<li>Use the Data Tools->Import/Export to load the results of
		on-line pre-registration. Encourage or require on-line pre-registration</li>
</ul>
