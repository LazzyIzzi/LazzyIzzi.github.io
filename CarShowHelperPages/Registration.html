<h3>Registration is a feature-rich form. Practice first before
	using at a show.</h3>
<p>Unless you are a skilled typist, it is difficult to keep up with
	day-of-show registration.</p>
Possible solutions:
<ul>
	<li>Divide registration among several several computers assigning
		a range of car numbers to each user, e.g. 1-99 to user1 100-199 to
		user2 etc. and merge the registration sheets after registration is
		closed.</li>
	<li>Use the Data Tools->Append Tables to load the results of
		on-line pre-registration. Encourage or require on-line pre-registration</li>
</ul>

<p>Dialog Items
<ul>
	<li>Hide/Show - roll/unrolls the Registration dialog so you can see the data in the sheet.</li>
	<li>Car No.- Displays the car number to register the current car.
		Its behavior depends on the Car Numbers Setting
	<ul>
		<li>Use Old - Defaults to the next available car number. Imports
			the old car number from the item selected in the search field.</li>
		<li>Use New - Displays the next available car number. You can also enter a number manually</li>
		<li>The Spinner bumps the car number by +/- 1</li>
		<li>Left click the "?" button to search the contacts sheet cars
			with the current car number</li>
		<li>Right click the "?" button get the next available car number.</li>
