<h4>
	CarShowHelper has two main worksheets, "Registration" and "Contacts"
	and a menu of tools for data entry, analysis, and record keeping. It
	may take some time to become familiar with its features and
	limitations. New users can run the <strong>Make Practice Data</strong>
	and <strong>Simulate Votes</strong> "learning" tools to explore and get
	comfortable with CarShowHelper without worry. Advanced users can access
	"Hidden" worksheets to create and edit custom car classification
	schedules, judging sheets, and a list of car makes and models. Below is
	a brief summary of CarShowHelper's Menus.

<h2>Sample Images from CSH</h2>
<p>With over 30 separate Dialog boxes(Excel UserForms), it is not
	realistic to show more than a few examples. Below are typical UserForms
	with comments about their use for a simulated show.</p>

<h3>Registration</h3>

<center>
	<figure class="easyimage easyimage-full">
		<img alt="" src="../CarShowHelperImages/CSH_Registration.png"
			width="500" />
		<figcaption>
			<Strong>Car Show Helper Registration Form. This form has
				search, editing, and some validation capabilities.</Strong>
		</figcaption>
	</figure>
</center>

<p>
	In this simulated show, Peyton Bentley came to the registration table.
	I started by typing his last name in the <strong>Last Name</strong>
	field. Auto-complete selections from the data in the Contacts sheet
	appeared. Clicking the down mark popped a list of suggestions. I
	selected "Bentley" and clicked the search <strong>?</strong> box. One
	hit from the Contacts sheet appeared in the bottom panel. I double
	clicked it to fill out the rest of the form with the Contacts sheet
	data. I confirmed with Peyton that the data was correct. Clicked <strong>Register</strong>.
</p>

CarShowHelper strives to reduce errors due to duplication,
mis-classification, bad ballots, bad math, bad sorting, etc.
<ul>
	<li>If Peyton Bentley is not in the Contacts sheet, the remaining
		required fields would need to be entered manually.</li>
	<li>If the Car Number Setting is <strong>Use New</strong>, the
		next available Car Number is automatically assigned.
	</li>
	<li>If the Car Number Setting is <strong>Use Old</strong>, both
		Last Name and Car Number can be searched and Peyton's old car number
		will be assigned.
	</li>
	<li>If the data for Peyton or his car is not correct, edit it and
		click the <strong>Update Contact</strong> button.
	</li>
	<li>Fields with potential errors are colored red. The e-mail is
		missing an @ and is highlighted. If the car is already registered, the
		<strong>Register</strong> button will pop-up an error message.
	</li>
</ul>


<h3>Judging</h3>
<p>
	The registration in our simulated show is now closed. This show judging
	setting is "Popular Choice by Class". The each paper ballot has one car
	number choice for each of twelve classes. I select <strong>Judging</strong>
	from the <strong>CarShow Tools</strong> menu and the dialog below
	appears.
</p>

<center>
	<figure class="easyimage easyimage-full">
		<img alt="" src="../CarShowHelperImages/CSH_PopVoteByClass.png"
			width="800" />
		<figcaption>
			<Strong>Popular Vote By Class judging dialog. This dialog
				will not allow votes for non-existent or wrong class cars.</Strong>
		</figcaption>
	</figure>
</center>

<p>
	There are no cars in the <strong>NC</strong> and <strong>DNJ</strong>
	classes so they are grayed. The ballot has a vote in the <strong>AB</strong>
	class for car 129. I clicked the AB class down arrow and can see that
	car 129 is not in that class. If 129 were entered as-is, an error
	message would have appeared when the vote was cast. I entered the
	remaining correct votes and clicked <strong>Vote</strong> to add the
	votes to the Registration sheet
</p>

<h3>Tally</h3>
<p>
	The judging ballot data has all been entered, show staff has picked the
	special awards cars. And it's time to pick the popular vote winners. I
	click <strong>Tally</strong> from the CarShow Tools menu and select the
	<strong>Run</strong> option and click <strong>OK</strong>. The
	registration table is sorted to show the class winners.
</p>

<center>
	<figure class="easyimage easyimage-full">
		<img alt="" src="../CarShowHelperImages/CSH_Tally.png" width="800" />
		<figcaption>
			<Strong>The Tally shows the top three cars in each class.
				Special Awards cars are not included in the regular tally results.</Strong>
		</figcaption>
	</figure>
</center>

<P>Other Tally options include</P>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Reset</strong> - un-does the Registration sheet Tally sorting. </li>
	<li><strong>Run &amp; Print</strong> - Run the Tally and print a
		de-personalized report for show winner announcements.</li>
	<li><strong>Run &amp; Save</strong> - Run the Tally and Save a
		de-personalized report to a file.</li>
	<li><strong>Run, Save &amp; eMail</strong> - Run the Tally, Save a
		de-personalized report to a file and email it to the announcer
		(requires MS Office and Internet connectivity).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Future Developments</h3>
<p>At a show, the input process can be pretty intense, even with the
	search capabilities. I'm working on adding voice inputs for judging
	sheets. Early tests work but need a quiet environment or a good
	noise-canceling microphone. I'm also testing optical mark recognition
	(OMR) for popular vote ballots. I have technologies for it but they are
	not well integrated with Excel. Also, my experience with paper
	popular-vote ballots is not encouraging. Lastly, CarShowHelper is a
	pretty complicated app. I'm thinking about making training videos but
	I'm pretty boring by disposition and probably need some help with the
	presentations.</p>
