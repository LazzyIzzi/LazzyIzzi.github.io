		<ul>
			<li>Favorites - Show winners are the ones with the most points.  Enter the how many will get trophies in the popup. (The figure uses a judging sheet so the Favorites option is hidden.)</li>
			<li>Most Points - Use with Popular Vote By Class. Show winners are the ones with the most points in each class.</li>
			<li>Points Ranges - Use with shows where cars compete against fixed standards and not each other. You can change the ranges setting if a Tally produces an inappropriate number of trophy winners. Click <strong>Guess Pts Ranges</strong> to get a rough guess for points ranges. Some refinement will probably be needed based on your judging standards.</li>
