<p>In addition to trophies, many car shows give special awards such as "Best in Show" or "Best Paint". These special awards and their winners are usually selected by the show staff or show sponsors outside of the normal judging process and are excluded from the normal Tally process. Therefore, special award winners should be selected before Tally.</p> 
<p>The Awards dialog is created from the Awards table in the hidden <strong>Judging</strong> sheet. Modify the Awards column in the table as needed for each show. To add a row, begin typing in the row below the "Awards" column. Do not modify the "Available" column entries.</p>

<p>There are two ways of assigning awards.</p>
<ol>
<li>Manually - Click in the Registration sheet Awards column and select the award from the pull-down list. Each award is removed from the pull-down list when it is assigned. To remove an award from a car, select its award cell and press the delete key. Deleted award assignments are returned to the awards pull-down list </li>
<li>Awards Dialog - Show staff or sponsors will usually provide a list of car numbers with awards. Use the Awards Dialog below to assign the special awards without scrolling through the Registration sheet. </li>
