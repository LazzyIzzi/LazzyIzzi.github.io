<p>Beam hardening is the shifting of the broad spectrum of a conventional x-ray source toward higher average (hard) energies as it passes through filters, samples and detectors.&nbsp;This results in an over-estimate of attenuation in thinner portions of the sample.&nbsp; It produces the well-known cupping artifact in tomographic images.</p>

<p>The ImageJ Beam Hardening Estimator plugin is built upon the <a href="MuMassCalculatorLib.html">Mu Mass Calculator</a> library.&nbsp; It provides an interactive way to estimate the severity of beam hardening artifact when acquiring radiographs or tomography data.</p>

<p>The above figure shows a schematic of a simple radiography or CT scanner. The arrow colors correspond to the plot colors(below), the arrow widths indicate spectral width and the length indicates intensity.</p>

<p>This figure shows the user dialog(left) and two windows(right) that are created or updated when the <strong>Update Plot</strong> button is clicked, (top) a plot of intensity vs X-ray energy at five sampling points along the beam path, and (bottom) the report issued for each trial configuration. The dialog values should be clear to persons familiar with conventional X-ray sources with the exception of the <strong>Formula</strong> which is entered as atom1:count1:atom2:count2... as required by MuMassCalculator.</p>

<p>Simple thresholding of tomographic reconstructions typically requires less than 5% beam hardening over the entire image to successfully segment the components.&nbsp; This may vary depending on materials contrast. The goal of this plugin is to quickly select a source, filter, and detector configuration that minimizes beam hardening while optimizing contrast and count rate using the sample <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0167-5087(83)90393-9" target="_blank">attenuation&cong;2 criterion</a> .&nbsp; A user makes appropriate selections in the non-modal dialog and clicks the <strong>Update Plot</strong> button.&nbsp; The spectral dependencies are displayed and the report is updated with the configuration and beam hardening metrics.</p>


<p>Special Note:&nbsp; This is <strong>NOT</strong> a detective quantum efficiency (DQE) calculator, the detector is modeled as ideal with the exception of a correction for photons that pass through the scintillator without being detected. Real detectors vary considerably in design, construction and response.</p>
