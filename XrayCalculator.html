<p>This figure shows the user dialog and the three windows that are created or updated by X-Ray Calculator.</p>
<p>The top portion of the dialog is for obtaining the absorption cross sections in cm<sup>2</sup>/gm for a specific photon energy. Select a material from the "Material Name" pull down menu or, alternatively enter:
<ul>
	<li>an atomic abbreviation for a single atom or enter a formula as atom1:count1:atom2:count2...
	<li>a density of the material.
</ul>

Enter a photon energy in KeV in the dialog field and click the <strong>Calculate</strong> button. The cross sections will be listed in the <strong>QuickCalc</strong> window.</p>

<p>The bottom portion of the dialog is for plotting attenuation spectra from 1KeV to 100GeV or anywhere in between for the formula entered above. The user can select the energy range, the cross-sections to plot, and log or linear axes. Optionally, the absorption edge energies for the elements in the formula can be listed. Clicking the <strong>Update Plot</strong> button will create/update the results. The plot window is ImageJ native with built-in tools for expanding, listing and fitting the attenuation data.</p>
