<p>Geodesic Distance operates on 2D and 3D images that have been "binarized" into "zero" and "non-zero" components.
Select "Map 0" or "Map !0" to select the component to map.</p>
<p>The "Output" pull down menu provides several options:</p>
<ul>
	<li>3D new Image - creates a 3D GDT new output stack.</li>
	<li>3D in Place - converts the current stack to a 32-bit 3D GDT</li>
	<li>2D new Image - creates a new stack of 32-bit 2D GDTs</li>
	<li>2D in Place - converts the current stack to a new stack of 32-bit 2D GDTs</li>
	<li>2D this slice new image - creates a 2D GDT of the current slice</li>
</ul>
Check the "Use Pixel Sizes" to map in physical pixel size units.  The default is unit pixels.
<p>The "Seed" pull down menu provides several options for the source points:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Left Slice - the GDT seed points are the entire left side of the 3D volume</li>
	<li>Right Slice - </li>
	<li>Top Slice - </li>
	<li>Bottom Slice - </li>
	<li>Front Slice - </li>
	<li>Back Slice - </li>
	<li>Point(s) - Use the ImageJ Roi Point tool to define one or more GDT source points.</li>
</ul>
<p>Select Geodesic Distance or Tortuosity radio button.
<br>For tortuosity from a volume surface, the tortuosity is the GDT distance from the surface divided by the straight line distance from the surface.
<br>For tortuosity from Point(s) sources,the tortuosity is the GDT distance from the nearest source point  divided by the straight line distance from the nearest source point.
<br> Note that the tortuosity using the "Point(s)" option is relatively slow.</p>

<h3>Geodesic Path 2D </h3>
<p>There is no user dialog for Geodesic Path 2D. It operates on 2D GDT images made with the Geodesic Transform plugin.
<ol>
<li>Select a "binarized" image or stack slice.</li>
<li>Run the Geodesic Transform plugin with one of the 2D options.</li>
<li>Select one or more points in one or more 2D GDT images.</li>
<li>Run Geodesic Path 2D from the plugins menu.</li>
</ol>
The shortest path from the selected points to the nearest "0" in the GDT will be added to the ROI Manager.

<h3>Geodesic Path 3D </h3>
<p> Geodesic Path 3D operates on 3D GDT images made with the Geodesic Transform plugin.
<ol>
<li>Select a "binarized" image or stack slice.</li>
<li>Run the Geodesic Transform plugin with one of the 3D options.</li>
<li>Select one or more points in one or more 3D GDT images.</li>
<li>Run Geodesic Path 3D from the plugins menu.</li>
</ol>
<center><figure class="easyimage easyimage-full"><img alt="" src="Images/Geodesic/GeodesicPath3DDialog.png" width="300" />
<figcaption><strong>Geodesic Path 3D Dialog</strong></figcaption></figure></center>
The shortest path from the selected points to the nearest "0" in the 3D GDT will be drawn as points.
<br>Show Path(s) option creates an new image with the path voxels set to 100 plus the point selection index.
<br>Write Path(s) to Roi Manager adds the path points an names each path.


<h3>Get GDT Path Points </h3>
<p>There is no user dialog for Get GDT Path Points.
<ol>
<li>Run a 2D or 3D geodesic path plugin on a GDT image. The 2D and 3D path plugins only operate on 2D and 3D GDT images respectively.The path point ROIs appear in the ROI manager.</li>
<li>The resulting paths can be applied to any image.</li> 
</ol>
For example, starting with a 3D image of a pore network containing a varying concentration of a substance.
<ol>
<li>Segment the pore network.</li>
<li>Compute the GDT of the network from some source point(s) or volume surface.</li> 
<li>Select test points in the GDT mapped pore network.</li>
<li>Run the shortest path plugin to obtain the shortest paths from the test points through the network to the source point(s) or surface.</li>
<li>Apply a path from the ROI manager to the original image.</li>
<li>Run "Get GDT Path Points" to get the substance concentration along that path.</li>
</ol>

Similarly, the distances along the path can be obtained by applying the ROI manager path to the pore network GDT image.  The concentration can then be plotted as a function of distance. At this writing, the ImageJ Plot tools are not well suited for combining data in this way.  Copy the two sets of path data to a spreadsheet application.
