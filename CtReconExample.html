<h4>Linearization using CT_recon</h4>
<p>
	The built-in beam hardening correction in the <a href="CtRecon.html"
		target="_self">CT_Recon</a> plugin creates an arbitary second-order
	polynomial correction that can minimize the cupping artifact but the
	linear attenuations in the reconstructed slice will usually be
	incorrect. If the specimen contains more than one material, the
	attenuations and their ratios can be used in the <a
		href="XrayLookupRatio.html" target="_self">Xray Lookup Ratio</a> and <a
		href="XrayLookupMuLin.html" target="_self">Xray Lookup MuLin</a>
	plugins to estimate an X-ray effective energy. If the Look-up plugins
	report the same energy for the attenuations and their ratios then the
	effective energy is approximately correct. In some cases the correct
	ratios and attenuations can be produced by multiplying the image by a
	constant, usually the ratio between the attenuation of a material at the axis of
	rotation in the corrected and uncorrected image.
</p>

<h4>Example - Qualitative imaging using CT_Recon's built-in beam hardening correction.</h4>
<p>With the exception of absorption edge crossing, the contrast due
	to composition decreases with increasing X-ray energy. The images below
	simulate the contrast between siderite(iron carbonate, bright) and
	quartz(gray) acquired at accelerating potentials of 80 and 160KV with a
	0.1cm copper filter.
<ol>
	<li>Simulation conditions were configured using the <a
		href="CtScannerSetup.html" target="_self">Scanner Setup</a> plugin.
	</li>
	<li>A tag image template was created from an microscope image of a sandstone.</li>
	<li>Sinograms were created from the tag image using the <a
		href="CTsimulator.html" target="_self">Polychromatic Parallel Beam
			CTscan</a> plugin
	</li>
	<li>Reconstruction were done using the <a href="CtRecon.html"
		target="_self">CT Recon Parallel Beam</a> plugin with no
		beam-hardening correction.

<p>
	The quartz(gray) in the 80KV image has been scaled to the same
	gray level as the 160KV image. The siderite(white) in the 80KV image is brighter than in the 160KV image indicating the loss os contrast with increasing energy.
<p> This contrast change is useful in separating materials, see <a
		href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-energy_X-ray_absorptiometry"
		target="_blank">DEXA</a>. In this example, the 160KV(scaled) attenuations has been scaled to
	match the level of quartz at 80KV. The forth image is a difference
	image showing only siderite. 
</p>


<p>Since the contrast changes with X-ray energy, it may be
	possible to estimate the X-ray energy from the contrast ratio.
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="XrayLookupRatio.html" target="_self">X-ray
			Ratio Lookup</a> plugin was used to obtain the effective energy(Eff)
		using the brightness ratio of the two materials.
	</li>
	<li>The <a href="XrayLookupMuLin.html" target="_self">X-ray
			MuLin Lookup</a> was used to obtain the Eff from the individual
		components.

<p>Although this is a good qualitative result, the X-ray energies calculated from the quartz and siderite attenuations and the attenuation ratio
	are not in good agreement. The setup indicated a small amount of
	residual beam hardening. If monochromatic X-rays had been used, all of
	the energies computed from attenuations and  ratios would be the same.</p>
