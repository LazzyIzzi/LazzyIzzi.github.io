<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>On this page we simulate correction of beam hardening
	artifacts using <a href="CtRecon.html" target="_self">CT Recon's</a> second order slider and <a href="Linearization.html" target="_self">Linearization
		Fitter's</a> 1-6th order fit.
<ul>
	<a href="CtRecon.html" target="_self">CT Recon Parallel Beam</a> Slider
	<li>does not require information about the X-ray source spectrum and
		specimen composition.</li>
	<li>is limited to a second-order fit using the dialog's
		beam-hardening slider 0 to 1 position "W" where <br><big>&tau;</big><sub><small>corr</small></sub>
		= (1-W)(<big>&tau;</big><sub><small>obs</small></sub>) + (W)(<big>&tau;</big><sup><small>2</small></sup><sub><small>obs</small></sub>)  
	(note that there is no constant term).
	</li>
	<li>can qualitatively suppress cupping artifact in most images.</li>
	<li>can, in reconstructions with two known materials, obtain single effective
		energy by scaling the image so that the <a href="XrayLookupMuLin.html"
		target="_self">X-ray MuLin Lookup</a> and the <a
		href="XrayLookupRatio.html" target="_self">X-ray Ratio Lookup</a> plugins give the same result. If more than two materials are present, it may not be possible
		to obtain a consistent energy result.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<a href="Linearization.html" target="_self">Linearization
		Fitter</a>

	<li>is model-based and requires information about the X-ray source spectrum and
		specimen composition.</li>
	<li>requires user selection of the X-ray energy that gives the best fit between specimen and
		model attenuations.</li>
	<li>can semi-quantitatively suppress cupping artifact in images that require a higher order fit.</li>
</ul>
Both the CT_Recon slider and the Linearization Fitter give improved estimates of linear attenuation when the X-ray spectrum is made more monochromatic by increasing the filtration. The <a href="CtScannerSetup.html" target="_self">Scanner Setup</a> plugin can help optimize the imaging conditions. In real CT systems it may be possible to reduce the attenuation error below the S/N of the measurement. 

<p>
	It is important to note that the validity of
	a linearization correction can vary significantly depending on the
	specimen spatial and compositional heterogeneity. You can use your
	images or the ImageJ drawing tools and the <a
		href="MaterialTagger.html" target="_self">Material Tagger</a> plugin
	to construct test cases to explore the limitations of linearization.

	artifacts by linearization with references to other methods see for

In this example we know the composition and density of the materials.  We can obtain effective energies from the quartz and tube linear attenuations using the <a href="XrayLookupMuLin.html" target="_self">X-ray MuLin Lookup</a> and <a href="XrayLookupRatio.html" target="_self">X-ray Ratio Lookup</a> plugins.

<h4>We repeat Example-1 using a model-based second order beam
hardening correction. See the

The images look the same as <a href="#example1">Example-1</a> and are not shown again here.  The animation below illustrates how the fit changes with X-ray energy. The higher attenuations are dominated by the tube and the lower attenuations are a mix of tube and quartz. Both are well centered around the fit line at 67keV.

<p>In this example we get an effective energy that is consistent with Example-1 after scaling. We note that the R<sup>2</sup> of the fit is not very sensitive the effective energy estimate. A higher order fit at the high attenuation data may give a slightly better result. In general, lower order fits are less sensitive to noise.</p>

<h2 id="example3">Example-3: Filtration and Linearization of a Structured Sample</h2>
<h3>How accurate are reconstructed attenuations after linearization?</h3>

<p>The attenuations are correct in CT slices obtained using monochromatic X-rays. Polychromatic X-rays produce beam hardened images that can be arbitrarily linearized to reduce the cupping artifact but the attenuations will most likely be incorrect. As the filtering of a conventional X-ray source increases, the beam becomes less polychromatic, attenuation errors decrease but the scan times increase.</p>

<p>The composition of CT specimens is often unknown. In that case, the cupping artifact can be suppressed but we are stuck with the incorrect attenuations. When the composition of the materials in the specimen is known, then the reconstructed image can be adjusted to minimize the errors. If the specimens are consistent as in QC/QA, then the filtering and linearization can be optimized a to give images of known attenuation accuracy in the shortest amount of time.</p>


The simulated example image was created using ImageJ drawing tools and the <a
		href="MaterialTagger.html" target="_self">Material Tagger</a> plugin. It is relatively large and contains strong x-ray absorbers.

In this example,
<ol>
<li>a higher source accelerating potential was used to produce x-ray energies that penetrate the brass.</li>
<li>a thick, strongly absorbing detector was needed to improve high energy response.</li>
<li>the first setup used a copper filter and produced ~16% beam hardening.</li>
<li>the second setup used tin filter and produced ~8% beam hardening.</li>
<li>sinograms for each setup were produced using the <a
		href="CTsimulator.html" target="_self">TagImage To Parallem Brems Sinogram</a> plugin.</li>
<li>The sinograms were reconstructed using  the <a href="CtRecon.html" target="_self">CT Recon Parallel Beam</a> plugin.</li>
</ol>

<h4>How close is the attenuation to the model at each setup when reconstructed with and without the CT-Recon plugin slider?</h4>

First, a few sample calculations.  With the CT_Recon slider set to 0, we use <a href="XrayCalculatorExcel.html" target="_self">NIST_XCOM.xlam</a> and 
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/define-and-solve-a-problem-by-using-solver-5d1a388f-079d-43ac-a7eb-f63e45925040" target="_self">Solver</a> Excel Addins to identify the X-ray energy that minimizes the RMS %Err without any beam hardening correctionand obtain 147keV and 9.6% error.

Example 1 showed that scaling the image can improve the fit. We again use the Solver to identify the X-ray energy and scale factor that minimize the RMS %Err without any beam hardening correction(slider=0) and obtain a small improvement.

The table below summarizes the best keV and scale fits for the both setups with and without the slider.

</center>

We see in the copper filtered image that using the slider to reduce the cupping artifact still results in an 5% RMS error in attenuation coefficient. The reduction in beam hardening using the tin filter is sufficient to reduce the error to about 1.3%, which is below the S/N in most reconstructions.  We could probably reduce the thickness of the tin filter to reduce the scan time and use the slider to still obtain a good result. The best fit X-ray energies are consistent with the detected X-ray intensity distributions shown below.
