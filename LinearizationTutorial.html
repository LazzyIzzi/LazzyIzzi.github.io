<h3>What is Linearization?</h3>
<p>
	Linearization is a technique to mitigate <a
		href="BeamHardeningTutorial.html" target="_self">beam-hardening</a>
	artifacts in projections and, therefore, the CT slices reconstructed
	from those projections. Conventional X-ray sources are polychromatic
	and will produce beam-hardening artifacts if not sufficiently filtered.
	The <a href="CtScannerSetup.html" target="_self">Scanner Setup</a>
	plugin provides a guide to configuring the source, filter, and detector
	to approximate a monochromatic X-ray source. When beam hardening
	artifacts persist, linearization provides a way to minimize the
	artifact and, in some cases, produce correct linear attenuations for
	the specimen materials.
</p>
<p>
	The linearization process typically uses a least-squares fit to identify a function, usually a
	polynomial<sup>1</sup> that, when applied to the measured attenuations
	vs thickness, transforms it into a linear function. The plot below
	shows a typical beam hardened attenuation vs thickness curve for a an
	aluminum specimen(black line), and three possible solutions.

<ul>
	<li>Linearizing fits are not unique. Most will mitigate
		beam-hardening artifact but the "corrected" attenuations will usually
		be wrong.</li>
	<li>Single material fits are not well constrained. The resulting
		images can be rescaled to any effective energy.</li>
	<li>Unlike the black line in the single material plot,
		multi-material plots may show significant scatter. The "best fit" is
		an approximation for the mix of materials.</li>
	<li>In some multi-material cases, where the composition is known,
		the fit can be constrained to the one that produces the correct
		attenuation and attenuation ratios for all of the materials in the
		specimen. See the <a href="LinearizationExample.html"
		target="_self">Linearization Example</a> page for examples of linearization using CT_Recon slider and the
		Linearization Fitter.
