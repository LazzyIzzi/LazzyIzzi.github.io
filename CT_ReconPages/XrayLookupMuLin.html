<h3>X-ray Lookup MuLin Summary</h3>
<ul>
	<li>It is not reliable above 500keV.</li>
	<li>It may return more than one energy if the material contains absorption edges.</li> 
	<li>Some of the energy solutions are easily eliminated if they are outside the x-ray source's operational range.</li>
	<li>It gives the correct X-ray energy from the input linear attenuation of a known material provided that the reconstruction algorithm used to produce the CT slice is quantitative.</li>
	<li>Solutions near absorption edge energies should be treated with caution since near-edge attenuation can be sensitive to an atom's chemical environment.</li>
	<li>To test the confidence of the reported energies, check the solutions returned at the standard deviations of the image data.</li>
</ul>
