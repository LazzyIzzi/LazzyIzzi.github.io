<p>The above figure shows a schematic of a simple radiography or CT
	scanner. The arrow widths indicate spectral width and the length
	indicates intensity.</p>



<p>Beam hardening is the shifting of the broad spectrum of a
	conventional x-ray source toward higher average (hard) energies as it
	passes through a material.&nbsp;Lower energy (longer wavelength) X-rays
	are preferentially attenuated leaving the higher energy, more
	penetrating X-rays for detection. It is mostly evident in the
	photoelectric energy range where the attenuation of materials changes
	rapidly with photon energy. The plot below illustrates this energy
	shift (plotted as wavelength for dramatic effect) caused by the beam
	passing through different thicknesses of copper.</p>

<p>
	When measuring attenuation of a specimen using a conventional
	bremsstrahlung x-ray source, we first measure the incident beam
	intensity "<em>I<sub>0</sub></em>". Then we put a specimen in the beam
	and repeat the measurement "<em>I</em> ". We know the thickness of the
	specimen so we can calculate the linear attenuation <big><em>&mu;&rho;</em></big>
	using the equation.

With
<big><em>&mu;&rho;</em></big>
in hand and if we know the the specimen's composition we can
<a href="XrayLookupMuLin.html" target="_self">look-up</a>
the "
<em>Effective</em>
" x-ray energy of the incident x-ray beam.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Definition: The <em>Effective Energy</em> is the monochromatic x-ray energy that
will produce the same attenuation as that measured with a given
polychromatic x-ray energy distribution.</strong>
<br>
<br>
But the distribution is changing as it passes through the specimen! So
we try again with a thinner specimen and sure enough, we get a different
effective energy. The plot below shows the use of different thickness
copper filters to remove a portion of the low-energy (soft) x-rays
incident on different thickness aluminum specimens. Unfiltered(red), the
effective energy changes from about 45keV in the 0.01cm specimen to
72keV for the 2.5cm thick one. By removing the soft x-rays from the
incident beam with a 0.1cm copper filter the average energy shifts to
about 90keV and remains nearly constant for all thicknesses of of
aluminum.

<h3>Why is Beam Hardening Important?</h3>
<p>Beam Hardening results in an over-estimate of attenuation by
	shorter paths through the specimen.&nbsp; It produces the well-known
	cupping and streak artifacts in reconstructed tomographic images.
	Cupping makes the image brighter at the thinner edges, streaks appear
	as brighter regions between more x-ray absorbing higher atomic number
	features in the specimen(streaks can also be caused by non-linear
	detector response).</p>

<h3>What can be done to reduce Beam Hardening?</h3>
<p>Apart from absorption edges, beam hardening is always present,
	lower energy x-rays are more strongly absorbed. But we can reduce the
	effect, hopefully below detection, by experimental technique and
	post-processing.</p>

<ol type="1">
	<li>Pre-harden the X-ray beam using a filter, usually a metal
		foil, located at the X-ray source. This can result in a substantial
		loss of x-ray intensity. If not already at maximum, the x-ray source
		current can be increased to offset the loss. Occasionally the
		accelerating potential of the X-ray source is increased to offset the
		decreased intensity caused by the filter absorbance. This is usually
		not a good idea. It raises the effective energy and lowers the sample
		attenuation an may result in additional noise in reconstructed slices.
		See the <a href="CtScannerSetup.html" target="_self">Scanner Setup</a>
		page for pre-hardening calculations.
	</li>
	<li>Apply a correction to the observed attenuations so that a plot
		of attenuation vs sample thickness becomes linear. The linearization
		function is usually a polynomial that is determined, depending on the
		information being sought, either by simply observing the quality of
		the corrected images or by careful calibration. Linearization is most
		successful when the sample is relatively homogeneous, i.e. when all
		rays passing through the sample see about the same average
		composition. See the  <a
		href="Linearization.html" target="_self">Linearization</a> page for more information. After
		correction by linearization the reconstructed image linear
		attenuations will be at a single effective energy. When samples are
		not relatively homogeneous, more advanced methods beyond the current
		scope of my plugins are required.
