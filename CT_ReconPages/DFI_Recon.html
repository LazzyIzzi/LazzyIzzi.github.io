<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
	Input sinograms are parallel-beam projected opacity <a
		href="MuMassCalculatorLib.html">(tau)</a> values acquired at equally
	spaced angles between 0 and 180 degrees of specimen rotation. Sinograms
	of this type can be obtained either by experiment or by digitally
	scanning test images with the parallel projector plugins described on
	the <a href="CTsimulator.html" target="_self">Scan Simulators</a> page.
	Sinogram images have dimensions of length(cm) in the horizontal(x)
	dimension and angle(theta) in the vertical(y) dimension. The DFI
	algorithm first computes the 1D FT of each of the rows(angles) in the
	sinogram. The f(r,theta) polar transforms are interpolated onto a 2D
	Cartesian f(x,y) grid to form the 2D FT of the image. The output image
	is computed from the inverse 2D FT of the interpolated transform. DFI
	is inherently noisier than other reconstruction techniques and produces
	significant artifacts if the input sinogram data does not cover the
	full 0-180 degree angular range. However, it has a significant speed
	advantage that makes it well suited for digital simulations.

<h3>Using DFI_JTransforms dialog</h3>
<H4>Dialog Components</H4>
<ul>
	<li>Beam Hardening - Applies a second order beam hardening correction
		to the sinogram attenuations <big>&tau;</big><sub><small>corr</small></sub> = (1-W)(<big>&tau;</big><sub><small>obs</small></sub>)
	+ (W)(<big>&tau;</big><sup><small>2</small></sup><sub><small>obs</small></sub>). The slider adjusts the weight between
		the first and second order terms. Crude but effective on many
		relatively homogeneous specimens. Reconstructions may require
		<a href="Linearization.html" target="_self">rescaling</a> to obtain correct linear attenuation values.</li>
	
	<li>Extension Width - Minimize artifacts arising from a portion of
		the specimen rotating outside the field of view by pasting "wings"
		onto the sinogram edges that decay smoothly from the edge attenuation
		value to zero. Pick a shape that works best for your sinogram.</li>
	<li>Axis Shift - A scan's axis of rotation is not always exactly
		centered on a pixel. Select a fractional shift and
		reconstruct a test slice to see if there is any improvement.The image data is shifted by
		interpolation so some loss of resolution may occur.</li>
	<li>Show Run Time - Check this box to see the time required for each portion of the reconstruction process. </li>
	<li>Show ROI - Draws an ROI around the  field of view inside the extension wings. </li>
	<li>Reconstruct Test Slice - Opens a "TestSlice" reconstructed
		image. Change a setting and click again to observe the result.</li>
	<li>OK(reconstruct) - Creates a new image or image stack with the
		final reconstruction(s)</li>
</ul>
