<h4>
	Scanner Setup is a 1D attenuation model that displays x-ray intensity
	distributions at important points along the ray path. The plugin
	provides a non-modal dialog to aid in selecting optimal CT scanner
	operating conditions to improve signal-to-noise and reduce <a

	artifact.

<ul>
	<li>Target - The anode material of a conventional X-ray source.</li>
	<li>KV - The accelerating potential of a conventional X-ray
		source.</li>
	<li>ma - The beam current of a conventional X-ray source.</li>
	<li>Filter Material - Usually a metal foil placed just downstream
		of the X-ray source.</li>
	<li>Filter Thickness(cm) - The thickness of the filter in
		centimeters.</li>
	<li>Sample Name Filter - Clips the materials list choices to those
		beginning with the characters in this textbox. Clear to restore the
		full list.</li>
	<li>Sample Name Choices -Pick a material from this list imported
		from <a href="MaterialsEditor.html" target="_self">DefaultMaterials.csv</a>
		in the plugins/DialogData folder.
	</li>
	<li>Sample Formula - Pre-populated from the name choice. Edit to
		change the sample formula.</li>
	<li>Sample Thickness(cm) - Pre-populated from the name choice.
		Edit to change the sample thickness.</li>
	<li>Sample Density(gm/cc) - Pre-populated from the name choice.
		Edit to change the sample density.</li>
	<li>Detector Name Filter - Clips the choices to those beginning
		with the characters in this textbox. Clear to restore the full list.</li>
	<li>Detector Name Choices -Pick a material from this list.</li>
	<li>Detector Formula - Pre-populated from the name choice. Edit to
		change the detector formula.</li>
	<li>Detector Thickness(cm) - Pre-populated from the name choice.
		Edit to change the detector thickness.</li>
	<li>Detector Density(gm/cc) - Pre-populated from the name choice.
		Edit to change the detector density.</li>
	<li>Plot Minimum(keV) - Sets the X-ray Spectra plot minimum
		energy. The maximum energy is the accelerating potential(KV).</li>
	<li>Plot Inc(keV - Sets the energy step size for the polychromatic
		scan. Large steps go faster. Small steps have better spectral
		resolution.</li>
	<li>keV Angstroms Buttons - Selects the plot x-axis scale</li>
	<li>Update Plot - Recalculate the plots and results.</li>
	<li>OK - Recalculate, update and exit leaving plot and results
		windows open</li>
	<li>Cancel - Exit closing plots and results windows.</li>
	<li>Help - Brings up this page.</li>
</ul>

<p>The top plot shows the relationship between sample thickness and
	attenuation. It should look like a nearly straight line if the incident
	photon beam is approximately monochromatic.</p>
<p>The middle plot shows intensity vs X-ray energy at five sampling
	points along the beam path.
<ul>
	<li>Blue, the source spectrum.</li>
	<li>Red, the source spectrum after the filter.</li>
	<li>Green, the source spectrum after the filter and sample.</li>
	<li>Gray, source spectrum after the filter detected. "Io"</li>
	<li>Black, the source spectrum after the filter and sample
		detected. "I"</li>
</ul>
<p>The window at the bottom shows the results for each trial
	configuration.</p>

<h3>The ImageJ plugin</h3>
<p>
	The <strong>Scanner Setup</strong> plugin helps to fine-tune the
	pre-hardening technique.
<ul>
	Pro:
	<li>It guides selection of the operating conditions that should
		optimize contrast and attenuation measurements for your sample.</li>
	<li>It provides an interactive way to minimize the severity of
		beam hardening.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	Con:
	<li>The detector is "ideal" in that it returns at each energy the
		fraction of counts absorbed by the scintillator screen. Energy
		dependent fluorescent yield, collection efficiency, gain and other
		characteristics of real detectors are neglected.</li>
	<li>The x-ray source intensity is calculated using the Kramers
		equation and neglects characteristic emission lines and source
		configuration.</li>
	<li>Specimen scatter and fluorescence are neglected.</li>
	<li>Due to the above characteristics, it may not be a good
		predictor of your scanner's performance.</li>
</ul>
