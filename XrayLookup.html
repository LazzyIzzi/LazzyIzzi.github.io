<h3>This plugin provides a non-modal dialog that allows the user to look up the X-ray energy that will produce an experimentally observed cross-section or cross-section ratio for atoms and compounds while working with other images.</h3>

<p>This figure shows the user dialog and the results window created and updated by X-Ray Lookup.</p>

<p>The top portion of the dialog <u>directly</u> obtains the photon energies that produce an observed linear attenuation. Use the pull-down menu to select a material or enter an image material's atomic abbreviation if it is a pure element or, if it is a compound, enter its formula as atom1:count1:atom2:count2.... Enter the observed linear attenuation in cm<small><sup>2</sup></small>/gm and the density of the component in gm/cm<small><sup>3</sup></small> in the dialog field and click the <strong>Get KeV</strong> button. The energy solutions will be listed in the <strong>KeV Solutions</strong> window.</p>

<p>The bottom portion of the dialog <u>indirectly</u> obtains the photon energies from a contrast ratio. It is assumed that brighter features are more attenuating. Use the pull-down menu to select materials or enter the two material's atomic abbreviations if they are a pure elements or, if they are compounds, enter the formulas as atom1:count1:atom2:count2.... Enter the observed brightness and the density of the components in gm/cm<small><sup>3</sup></small> in the dialog fields and click the <strong>Get KeV from ratio</strong> button. The energy solutions will be listed in the <strong>KeV Solutions</strong> window.</p>

<h3>Limitations.</h3>

<p>The look-up methods are intended to be used with internal standards of known composition and density. The standards should be placed at strategic locations on and within the CT scan specimen and each standard's attenuations measured in the reconstructed slices. These measurements are used to guide beam hardening corrections, if needed, and quantitative analysis of component concentrations. If standards cannot be used, then the specimen's materials can sometimes be used with limited success if the compositions and densities of the measured regions can be confirmed by independent analysis.</p>

<p>The plots below compare the barite/quartz and calcite/quartz contrast ratios as a function of photon energy.</p>

<p>The heavy gray lines are the contrast ratios of (left) calcite (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) to quartz (SiO<sub>2</sub>) and (right) barite (BaSO<sub>4</sub>) to quartz (SiO<sub>2</sub>) as a function of x-ray energy. The blue lines are the linear attenuations of calcite(left) and barite(right)(The sharp discontinuity in barite is the K absorption edge) and the red lines are the linear attenuation of quartz.</p>

<h3>How it works (direct look-up).</h3>
<p>The left vertical axis is linear attenuation. The dashed lines are observed linear attenuations.  Where they intersect the solid color lines are the direct solutions. Note that the barite red dash line has two solutions. The vertical line at the barite K edge does not represent a solution.

<h3>How it works (indirect look-up).</h3>
<p>The right vertical axis is the contrast ratio. The dashed lines are observed ratios. Where they intersect the heavy gray line are the indirect solutions.
<p>Casual inspection shows that contrast ratios like the ones shown by the blue dashed lines are insensitive to photon energy above about 500keV and have no solution below(not very useful).  Contrast ratios like the green dashed lines have a weak dependence below about 30keV and are multi-valued(use with caution). Ratios like the red lines are in the "sweet spot" with contrast-energy dependencies that can give meaningful results.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Neither the direct or indirect method is reliable above 500keV.</li>
	<li>The indirect or ratio method is contrast dependent.</li>
	<li>The direct method may return more than one energy if the material contains an absorption edges.</li> 
	<li>Some of the energy solutions are easily eliminated if they are outside the x-ray source's operational range.</li>
	<li>The direct method is the best choice provided that the reconstruction algorithm used to produce the CT slice is quantitative, i.e. it gives the correct linear attenuation of a known material<sup>1</sup>.</li>
	<li>Solutions near absorption edge energies should be treated with caution since the near-edge energy range can be sensitive to the atom's chemical environment.</li>
	<li>The accuracy of the look-up will depend on the image data. The precision can vary substantially as observed in the above examples. To test the confidence of the reported energies, check the solutions returned at the standard deviations of the image data.
	<li>At this point it should be clear why carefully chosen internal "witness" standards are important to accurate analysis.</li>
</ul>

<P><small>1. A simple test is to create a synthetic digital image and scan it with a monochromatic projector.  Reconstruct the sinogram with your reconstruction package. It should return the synthetic image plus some noise. A more severe test is to scan it with a bremsstrahlung scanner and apply a beam hardening correction during reconstruction.</small></P>
