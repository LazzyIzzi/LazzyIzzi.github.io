<p>This plugin provides a non-modal dialog that allows the user to look up the X-ray energy that has will produce an experimentally observed cross-section or cross-section ratio for atoms and compounds while working with other images. </p>

<p>The X-ray Lookup plugin is built upon the <a href="MuMassCalculatorLib.html">Mu Mass Calculator</a> library.</p>
<p>Before we begin, a few words of caution. Chemical elements can have the same attenuation at more than one photon energy. This is most evident in the photoelectric regime of heavier elements with absorption edge discontinuities in their absorption spectra.  Examining the plot on the X-ray Calculator page, the attenuation of lead chromate is the nearly the same at 10 and 14 KeV. At higher energies, particularly the pair production regime, the total attenuation is nearly independent of photon energy. <ins>When attenuation is obtained quantitatively, the X-Ray Lookup plugin will report all energies that will produce that attenuation.</ins> </p>

<p>Frequently, images have been scaled prior to display and the attenuations are no longer in cm<small></small><sup>2</sup></small>/gm units.  This condition can also occur when correcting tomographic images for beam hardening using a linearization technique. In this case, the ratio of the attenuations of two or more components can be used to determine the effective energy for the CT scan.   When obtaining the energy using the ratio method, it is important to note that the sensitivity can vary significantly depending on the &mu;<sub>lin</sub> ratio of the components vs photon energy. The method gives best results when comparing compounds of different average atomic number.</p>

<p>This figure shows the user dialog and the results window that is created or updated by X-Ray Lookup.</p>
<p>The top portion of the dialog is for obtaining the photon energy that produces an observed linear attenuation. Enter an image component's atomic abbreviation if it is a pure element or, if it is a compound, enter its formula as atom1:count1:atom2:count2... as required by MuMassCalculator. Enter the observed linear attenuation in cm<small><sup>2</sup></small>/gm and the density of the component in gm/cm<small><sup>3</sup></small> in the dialog field and click the <strong>Get KeV</strong> button. The energy solutions will be listed in the <strong>KeV Solutions</strong> window.</p>

<p>The bottom portion of the dialog is for obtaining the photon energy that produces an observed image brightness ratio. It is assumed that brighter features are more attenuating. Enter the two image component's atomic abbreviations if they are a pure elements or, if they are compounds, enter the formulas as atom1:count1:atom2:count2... as required by MuMassCalculator. Enter the observed brightness and the density of the components in gm/cm<small><sup>3</sup></small> in the dialog fields and click the <strong>Get KeV from ratio</strong> button. The energy solutions will be listed in the <strong>KeV Solutions</strong> window.</p>

<p>Note: The results and plot window do not necessarily appear in the locations shown in the figure.</p>
